There are two types of lock1. Intrinsic Lock : Thease are build in every Object.You dont see them but they are there.When yuo use the synchronized keywoprdyou are using these automatic locks.Lets say we have t1 and t2 trying to access a Synchronized block.the block is locked by t1.t2 cannot access it unless t1 has completed its execution even though there is sleep() method added.2. Explicit Lock : These are more advanced locks you can control yourself using the Lock Class from java.util.concurrent.locks.You explicitely say when to lock and unlock.giving you more control over how and when people can write in the notebook.Different methods of Locks :1. lock : Just like Synchronzd lock.lock() will make the thread wait until the lock is released.Not used much2.TryLock : Will make the thread try to acquire the lock.If it Cannot acquire the lock,it will leave.3.Unloack : Unlock the thread.
